## Available Scripts

In the main project directory, you can run firstly:

### `yarn cli`

to run the models generator.

The generator will ask you
1) to type/paste the Liferay's project path  
2) to choose which path you want to crawl to extrapolate the models from

If all goes well you can run 

### `yarn diagram`

to start the site in devoplent mode [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser). 
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console

<u>otherwise</u>


### `yarn build`

to build the static files contained in `/diagram-db-react/build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
